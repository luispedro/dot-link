  abstract =	 {In this paper we address the problem of constructing
                  an index for a text document or a collection of
                  documents to answer various questions about the
                  occurrences of a pattern when allowing a constant
                  number of errors. In particular, our index can be
                  built to report all occurrences, all positions, or
                  all documents where a pattern occurs in time linear
                  in the size of the query string and the number of
                  results. This improves over previous work where the
                  lookup time always depended upon the size of the
                  document corpus. Our data structure has size
                  $\moof{n\log^k n}$ on average and with high
                  probability for input size $n$ and queries with up
                  to $k$ errors. Additionally, we present a trade-off
                  between query time and index complexity that
                  achieves worst-case bounded index size and
                  preprocessing time with linear lookup time on
                  average.}
