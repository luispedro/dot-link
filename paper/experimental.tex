\subsection{Implementation and Data Sets}

The code was implemented in the C~Language, starting from the suffix tree implementation by FIXME.

Three data sets were used:

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``Democracy in America'' by Alexis de Tocqueville as natural language data ser
\item The DNA of S. Cervesiae
\item Randomly generated text
\end{enumerate}
